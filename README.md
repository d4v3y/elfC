# ELF Practice
C program that stores data in an array, computes the sum, average, maximum and minimum values of the array. A main and three functions is used â€” a summing/averaging, a maximum and a minimum. Each function is in a separate file. Also, the array is global (so that it is visible to the linker), which is not an argument to any of the functions.
